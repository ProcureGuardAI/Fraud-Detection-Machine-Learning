to reflect the price of a missing or non -conforming item or 
component , by adding the average price of the item or 
component quoted  by substantially responsive Bidders . If

amount in words shall prevail, unless the amount 
expressed in words is related to an arithmetic error, in 
which case the amount in figures shall prevail sub ject 
to (a) and (b) above.

Section VI  - Fraud and Corruption  
(Section VI shall not be modified)  
1. Purpose  
1.1 The Bank’s Anti -Corruption Guidelines and this annex apply with respect to procurement 
under Bank Investment Project Financing operations.  
2. Requirements  
2.1 The Ban k requires that Borrowers (including beneficiaries of Bank financing); bidders  
(applicants/proposers) , consultants, contractors and suppliers; any sub -contractors, sub -
consultants, service providers or suppliers; any agents (whether declared or not); and a ny 
of their personnel, observe the highest standard of ethics during the procurement process, 
selection and contract execution of Bank -financed contracts, and refrain from Fraud and 
Corruption.  
 
2.2 To this end, the Bank:  
a. Defines, for the purposes of this prov ision, the terms set forth below as follows:  
i. “corrupt practice” is the offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting, directly 
or indirectly, of anything of value to influence improperly the actions of 
another party;  
ii. “fraudulent practice” is any act or omissi on, including misrepresentation, 
that knowingly or recklessly misleads, or attempts to mislead, a party to

iii. “collusive practice” is an arrangement between two or more parties 
designed to achieve a n improper purpose, including to influence 
improperly the actions of another party;  
iv. “coercive practice” is impairing or harming, or threatening to impair or 
harm, directly or indirectly, any party or the property of the party to 
influence improperly the ac tions of a party;  
v. “obstructive practice” is:  
(a) deliberately destroying, falsifying, altering, or concealing of 
evidence material to the investigation or making false statements 
to investigators in order to materially impede a Bank 
investigation into allegati ons of a corrupt, fraudulent, coercive, 
or collusive practice; and/or threatening, harassing, or 
intimidating any party to prevent it from disclosing its 
knowledge of matters relevant to the investigation or from 
pursuing the investigation; or  
(b) acts intende d to materially impede the exercise of the Bank’s 
inspection and audit rights provided for under paragraph 2.2 e. 
below.  Section VI – Fraud and C orruption  70 
 
b. Rejects a proposal for award if the Bank determines that the firm or individua l 
recommended for award, any of its personnel, or its age nts, or its sub -
consultants, sub -contractors, service providers, suppliers and/ or their 
employees, has, directly or indirectly, engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, 
coercive, or obstructive practices in competing for the contract in question;  
c. In add ition to the legal remedies set out in the relevant Legal Agreement, may

any part of the procee ds of the loan engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, 
coercive, or obstructive practices during the procurement process, selection 
and/or execution of the contract in question,  without the Borrower having taken 
timely and appropriate action satisfacto ry to the Bank to address such practices 
when they occur, including by failing to inform the Bank in a timely manner at 
the time  they knew of the practices;  
d. Pursuant to the Bank’s Anti - Corruption Guidelines , and in accordance with the 
Bank’s prevailing sanctions policies and procedures, may sanction a firm or 
individual, either indefinitely or for a stated period of time, including by 
publicly declaring such firm or individual ineligible (i) to be awarded or 
otherwise benefit from a Bank -financed contrac t, financially or in any other 
manner;1 (ii) to be a nominated2 sub-contractor, consultant, manufacturer or 
supplier, or service provider of an otherwise eligible firm being awarded a 
Bank -financed contract; and (iii) to receive the proceeds of any loan ma de by 
the Bank or otherwise to participate further in the preparation or implementation 
of any Bank -financed project;  
e. Requires that a clause be included in bidding/request for proposals documents 
and in contracts financed by a Bank loan, requiring (i) bid ders 
(applicants/proposers) , consultants, contractors, and suppliers, and their sub -
contractors, sub -consultants, service providers, suppliers, agents , personnel, 
permit the Bank to inspect3 all accounts, records and other documents relating 
to the procure ment process, selection and/or contract execution , and to have 
them audited by auditors appointed by the Bank.  
                                              
1  For the avoidance of doubt, a sanctioned party’s ineligibility to be awarded a contract shall include, without limitation,

contractor, nominated consultant, nominated manufacturer or supplier, or nominated service provider, in respect of such 
contract, and (ii) entering into an addendum or amendment introducing a material mo dification to any existing contract.  
2  A nominated sub -contractor, nominated consultant, nominated manufacturer or supplier, or nominated service provider 
(different names are used depending on the particular bidding document) is one which has been: (i) i ncluded by the bidder 
in its pre -qualification application or bid because it brings specific and critical experience and know -how that allow the 
bidder to meet the qualification requirements for the particular bid; or (ii) appointed by the Borrower.    
3  Inspections in this context usually are investigative (i.e., forensic) in nature.  They involve fact -finding activities 
undertaken by the Bank or persons appointed by the Bank to address specific matters related to investigations/audits, 
such as evaluating the veracity of an allegation of possible Fraud and Corruption, through the appropriate mechanisms.  
Such activity includes but is not limited to: accessing and examining a firm's or individual's financial records and 
information, and making copies thereof  as relevant; accessing and examining any other documents, data and information 
(whether in hard copy or electronic format) deemed relevant for the investigation/audit, and making copies thereof as 
relevant; interviewing staff and other relevant individual s; performing physical inspections and site visits; and obtaining 
third party verification of information.  Part 2 – Supply Requirements  71

 Section IX - Special Conditions of Contract  115 
Attachment: Price Adjustment Formula  
 
If in accordance with  GCC 15.1,  prices shall be adjustable, the following method shall be used 
to calculate the price adjustment:  
 
15.1  Prices payable to the Supplier, as stated in the Contract, shall be subject to adjustment 
during performance of the Contract to reflect changes in the cost of labor and material 
components in accordance with the formula:  
 
P1 = P 0 [a + bL1 + cM 1] - P0 
 L0  M0 
 
a+b+c = 1  
in which:  
 
P1 = adjustment amount payable to the Supplier.  
P0 = Contract Price (base price).  
a = fixed element representing profits and overheads included in the Contract 
Price and generally in the range of five (5) t o fifteen (15) percent.  
b = estimated percentage of labor component in the Contract Price.  
c = estimated percentage of material component in the Contract Price.  
L0, L1 = *labor indices applicable to the appropriate industry in the country of 
origin on the base date and date for adjustment, respectively.  
M0, M 1 = *material indices for the major raw material on the base date and date for 
adjustment, respectively, in the country of origin.  
 
The Bidder shall indicate the source of the indices , and the  source of  exchange rate (if 
applicable)  and the base date indices in its Bid. 
 
The coefficients a, b, and c as specified by the Purchaser are as follows:  
 
a = [insert value of coefficient]   
b = [insert value of coefficient]  
c = [insert value of coefficient]  
 
Base d ate = thirty (30) days prior to the deadline for submission of the Bids. 
 
Date of adjustment = [insert number of weeks]  weeks prior to date of shipment 
(representing the mid -point of the period of manufacture).  
 
The above price adjustment formula shall be invoked by either party subject to the 
following further conditions:  
 
(a) No price adjustment shall be allowed beyond the original delivery dates.  As a rule, 
no price adjustment shall be allowed for periods of delay for which the Supplier is Section IX – Special Conditions of Contract  116 
 
 
entirely responsib le. The Purchaser will, however, be entitled to any decrease in 
the prices of the Goods and Services subject to adjustment.  
 
(b) If the currency in which the Contract Price P 0 is expressed is different from the 
currency of origin of the labor and material indi ces, a correction factor will be 
applied to avoid incorrect adjustments of the Contract Price.  The correction factor 
shall be: Z 0 / Z1, where,  
 
Z0 = the  number of units of currency of the origin of the indices which equal to 
one unit of the currency of the  Contract Price P 0 on the Base date, 
and 
 
Z1 = the number of units of currency of the origin of the indices which equal to 
one unit of the currency of the Contract Price P 0 on the Date of 
Adjustment.  
 
(c) No price adjustment shall be payable on the portion of the Contract Price paid to 
the Supplier as advance payment.
